## Installation and Usage

To install the modpack, download your desired version from the releases page, extract it into your Hades\Content folder, and run modimporter.exe.

Once the modpack is installed, enter the courtyard in-game and press the boon menu button. If you've installed correctly, you'll see a RunControl button, where you can select a run and configure the mods.
